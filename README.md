# oss-soft-serve

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and your sass in `_sass`. To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "oss-soft-serve"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: oss-soft-serve
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install oss-soft-serve

## Usage


There are quite a few well-done, and over-done, templates for agencies, portfolios and blogs. What about the developer who wants to just promote this great thing they made?

Your thing, simply presented & well documented for all to see. Nothing aggressive, just soft-serve?

## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem "oss-soft-serve"
```

Add this to your `_config.yaml`.

```yaml
theme: oss-soft-serve
permalink: /docs/:title
