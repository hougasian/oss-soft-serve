There are quite a few well-done, and over-done, templates for agencies, portfolios and blogs. What about the developer who wants to just promote this great thing they made?

Your thing, simply presented & well documented for all to see. Nothing aggressive, just soft-serve?

## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem "oss-soft-serve"
```

Add this to your `_config.yaml`.

```yaml
theme: oss-soft-serve
permalink: /docs/:title
```

Delete `about.md`.

```
rm about.md
```

Bring it all together with...

```
$ bundle
$ jekyll s
```
